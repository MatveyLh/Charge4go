There were some difficulties in completing the assignment.
Firstly, there was not enough layout, because when you typeset some task, you always want to be focused on the result.
There was not enough pagination for the api request, if we want to get the best performance,
then it would be worth adding. I didn't quite understand how to implement the menu item with the map correctly,
because it was not visible in the photo, so I brought it to the menu item, I hope I did everything right.
Since there was no agreement on loading data, I preferred to load everything through the Next Js methods.
In any case, initially only the first page will be loaded as SSR and all others as SPA.

    Thanks for the opportunity! :)
